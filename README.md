# SuperBlog

This is the most secure Blog CMS on the planet.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.0+
- MySQL
- Apache or Nginx
- Composer

## Installation

Put the code somewhere your Web Server can find it.

Run composer install

For now you'll need to create the database manually. There's methods that will create the tables in the SuperBlog class.

## TODO

I'm still building an installer script for setting up the database tables
Also, everything else :-/
