SuperBlog
==========

This is an experimental project to build a Blog engine from scratch


Requirements
-------------

* PHP 7.0+
* MySQL
* Apache or Nginx
* Composer


Installation
-------------

Put the code somewhere your Web Server can find it. I'm using the userdir module with Apache for now.

Run composer install

For now you'll need to create the database manually. There's methods that will create the tables in the SuperBlog class.

TODO
------

I'm still building an installer script for setting up the database tables
Also, everything else :-/
